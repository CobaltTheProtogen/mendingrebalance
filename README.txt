# COBALT'S MENDING REBALANCE

The **Mending** enchantment has long been considered one of the most overpowered enchantments in Minecraft. With this mod, the goal is to introduce a more balanced approach while making the Anvil and Grindstone more useful in the game.

### Key Features:
- **Mending has 5 levels**: The enchantment now scales with 5 levels, each providing a progressively stronger repair effect.
- **Repair Cap**: Mending now has a repair cap based on its level. 
  - At Level 1, it repairs **25%** of a tool’s durability and **17%** of armor’s durability.
  - At Level 5, it can **fully repair** the item.
  
- **Mending Potion**: A potion version of Mending has been added. This potion does not consume experience orbs, and its effects scale with the enchantment’s level.
  - To brew the Mending Potion, you need to combine a **Mending book** or an item with the corresponding enchantment level into an **awkward potion**.

### Why This Change?
Currently, Mending allows players to infinitely repair their items by simply building an experience farm. This mod changes that by limiting the amount of durability restored, ensuring the enchantment doesn’t make anvils obsolete. The potion version of Mending offers a non-experience-based alternative but still requires progression to brew.
